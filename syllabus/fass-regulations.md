# FASS Regulations

**REGULATIONS COMMON TO ALL HISTORY COURSES**

**COPIES OF WRITTEN WORK SUBMITTED**&#x20;

Always retain for yourself a copy of all essays, term papers, written assignments or take-home tests submitted in your courses.&#x20;

**PLAGIARISM**&#x20;

The University Senate defines plagiarism as “_presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.”_ This can include:&#x20;

·       reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source;

·       submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else;&#x20;

·       using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment;&#x20;

·       using another’s data or research findings;&#x20;

·       failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks;&#x20;

·       handing in "substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs."&#x20;

Plagiarism is a serious offence which cannot be resolved directly with the course’s instructor. The Associate Dean of the Faculty conducts a rigorous investigation, including an interview with the student, when an instructor suspects a piece of work has been plagiarized. Penalties are not trivial. They can include a final grade of "F" for the course.&#x20;
