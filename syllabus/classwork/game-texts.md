# Game Texts

Inside “the game”, each student will be expected to produce work (a minimum of roughly 10-12 pages by the end of the term) which is intended to record or influence the actions of other participants or the outcome of the game. Depending on your character, it could be composing a persuasive speech to be performed in class, writing a letter to attack someone’s honour or composing a military strategy depending on the objective being pursued. Certain players may also be asked to produce more creative projects (such as a reliquary for the robe of Saint Martin). When and what you will be expected to compose will depend on what character you are playing and your specific goals.

As well, each round you will need to provide your faction leader (or assigned surrogate) with decisions you have made about that week’s strategic decisions (resource allocation, faction changes etc.).
