# Game Texts

Inside “the game”, each student will be expected to produce work (a minimum of roughly 10 pages by the end of the term) which is intended to record or influence the actions of other participants or the outcome of the game. Your game texts likely includes a [speech](speech.md) that will need to be presented in class in a formal fashion, which also will be assessed as a performance (see [speech](speech.md)).&#x20;

Depending on your character, your assigned work could be composing a persuasive speech to be performed in class, writing a letter to attack someone’s honour or composing a military strategy depending on the objective being pursued. Certain players may also be asked to produce more creative projects (such as a reliquary for the robe of Saint Martin). When and what you will be expected to compose will depend on what character you are playing and your specific goals.

As well, each round you will need to provide your faction leader (or assigned surrogate) with decisions you have made about that week’s strategic decisions (resource allocation, faction changes etc.).

**Assessment**:&#x20;

Game texts will be assessed at the end of term, after the completion of the game. Students will compile a dossier on cuPortfolio, including the text/notes of their speech, any para-game texts (such as rumours, poems, panygerics), as well as any written discussion composed for online discussions (via Slack), which develop the game play.&#x20;
