# Participation

This component measures your degree of involvement in the course – attending class and being willing to discuss the readings, and –during the game play sessions– being prompt in providing updates and strategic decisions to your classmates, being an active participant in class both as a student and gameplayer. As a student, you are expected to have read and assimilated the material for discussion each week. You will be called upon to recall the nuance of the readings and discuss its content, potential biases and implications for your understanding of Merovingian society. **Attendance is mandatory and students who miss more than six (6) classes will not be able to pass the course**. As a player, you are expected to have read the player’s manual, and used your knowledge to act in a historically appropriate fashion.&#x20;

At the end of term, students will assign themselves (and have to justify in writing based on a template provided) a grade for participation based on conditions to be distributed. Your participation mark will also be somewhat determined by your teammates – they will have a chance to honour the active participants and shame the passive ones.

**Assessment**: self-assessed based on provided criteria, 30% of final grade
