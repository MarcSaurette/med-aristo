# Speech

Every student (with a few exceptions†), will present a formal speech in one of the five scenarios. The speech will address one of the five questions posed in the game scenarios, and they must show:

1.  preparation (such as the ability to cite relevant primary sources and to draw on what historians have argued about the topic).&#x20;

    • content (facts, examples, laws, biblical citations)

    • argument (your speech must argue a point).&#x20;
2. style (such as the ability to speak persuasively, and in a fashion suitable for the character and time period)

**Assessment**:

Your speech will be assessed not on quantity of words, but on quality of engagement.&#x20;

† A few characters have a role as chronicler, as so their written work will be assessed without being orally delivered (the marks assigned for the oral presentation will, in these rare cases) be lumped into the "game texts" marks.&#x20;
