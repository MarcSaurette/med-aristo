# Character Description

On cuPortfolio, you will develop a “biography” of the character you are inhabiting. Some characters are historical people and others are left to be fleshed out from historical archetypes by the students. A first draft of the character biography is due early in the term to ensure students know the key historical details of their character. Students are encouraged to keep adding to it over the course of the class. At minimum, your profile should note the name, station, motivations (but **do not** publicize any private objectives or motivations from your character sheet, if you have them). If you are a landed aristocrat, you might want to describe your holdings (explore its geography, its resources in the sixth century). If you are a nun, for example, you might want to describe your monastery or the family you came from. If you are a real historical person, research the biography of your character up until 561 and what is known about them after this time. Most Merovingian people are not well known and little evidence about them survives, so part of your goal will be to make informed decisions based on generalizable evidence of the period (i.e. what would it be normal for a Merovingian abbot to act or to think). Your profile must be supported by primary and secondary sources.
