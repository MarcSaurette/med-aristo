# Assessment

We will be using a simplified form of assessment for this class. All work will be assessed as either Unsatisfactory, Satisfactory or Excellent. If all your work is assessed as **Satisfactory**, you will receive a B. If all your work is assessed as **Excellent**, you will receive an A+. If you receive a mixture of these two, your grade will fall somewhere in the middle. Work deemed unsatisfactory can be reworked and submitted for reassessment.

[Participation](classwork/participation.md) will be self-assessed.&#x20;

Your final mark will assessed based on your completion of the following coursework:&#x20;
