# Zotero

You don't need to use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) (though I recommend you do) for bibliographic management.&#x20;

I have put together a group library for class on Zotero, containing the most recent (and most foundational) works on Merovingian history. If you are looking for material on a specific topic, this "library" (or really just a curated bibliography of important works, is easily searchable by students.&#x20;

The library exists here: [https://www.zotero.org/groups/4528832/divided\_kingdoms](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4528832/divided\_kingdoms), but you will need to be invited by me first, which I will do at the beginning of class.&#x20;
