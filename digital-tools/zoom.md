# Zoom

In the _rare chance_ that our in-person class needs to be cancelled due to campus closing down, or the professor being under quarantine measure, we may have the odd class in which we meet via Zoom. This is purely a backup set-up in case normal conditions cannot take place. &#x20;

You likely all have Zoom installed on one of your many different devices, but if not, please visit the app store of your mobile device or download a desktop version ([https://zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download)). You can also use Zoom via a browser.

Our recurring meeting information is as follows:

**Topic:** HIST3005 - Medieval Aristocratic Life
