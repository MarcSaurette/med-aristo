# Slack

To help with communication in this class, I want to try to avoid email, but instead will try to centralize communication through **Slack** (which I am told is similar to _Discord_). Slack is a group messenger application that can be installed on your phone and tablet, used on your browser or a desktop app. Via Slack, I will post class information and game updates, you can speak with your fellow students (and later, faction members), and you can also arrange small group video-conferencing if you want meet virtually with friends, allies or foes!

1. Download desktop apps [here](https://slack.com/downloads/) and other versions depending on the OS of your mobile device.
2. Register yourself and sign in to our slack group – dividedkingdoms561.slack.com – **I will send out an invitation** and necessary login information to everyone's cmail account after our first class (**January 10th**!).
3. Slack allows people to create private and public channels. Most necessary channels will be  automatically displayed for you and once the game begins (or after your characters have been assigned), you will be entered into private channels along with other faction members. If you want to see all the public channels I (or your fellow students) have made, click on the header "Channels" in the sidebar (on desktop or browser versions). It should say "Browse all channels" if you hover your cursor over it. Add yourself to all the public channels you can/want, by clicking on a channel and then pressing the "Join" button. These channels will now remain in your sidebar, updating you on contributions people make.
