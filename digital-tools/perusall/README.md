# Perusall

Perusall will act as a repository for the readings for our class. For the first weeks of class, readings will be assigned and you are expected to make at least three annotations per reading. Make three annotations per reading assignment (i.e. each text, not each class) and you get full marks for reading. You don't, you don't get anything. &#x20;
